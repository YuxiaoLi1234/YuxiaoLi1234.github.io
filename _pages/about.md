I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at The Ohio State University, advised by Prof. Hanqi Guo. I obtained my M.S. degree from the School of Data Science at Fudan University in 2023 and my B.S. degree from the West China School of Medicine at Sichuan University in 2021. My research interests include data visualization, topological data analysis, and data compression.
